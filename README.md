## Tinc VPN Configurations

[Tinc](http://tinc-vpn.org/) is a multi-platform user-space VPN that's been around for almost twenty years. 

I find it pretty slick but as a testimate to how easy it is, I often forget how to set up new hosts. 

This repo is just a collection of guides for configurations I use across various OS's.
